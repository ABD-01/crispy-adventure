## Introduction

Hi! <img src="_static/Hi.gif" height="1.5em">

A candid moment captured at IvLabs, running "Self-Balancing Bicopter" project the last time before dismantling it to salvage its BLDCs.

My name is Muhammed Abdullah Shaikh. I recently graduated with a degree in Electrical and Electronics
from [Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visvesvaraya_National_Institute_of_Technology_Nagpur), an institute of national importance.
My work for past few months have been focused on embedded systems, particularly overseeing the network module supporting TCP, MQTT and other activities such as FOTA for an NXP i.MX RT microcontroller via a GSM modem. interests

Managed to teleoperate the Kubuki Turtlebot 2 after a tough day of fixing issues.
```

Most of my collegiate work took place at [IvLabs, the AI and Robotics lab](https://www.ivlabs.in/) of VNIT. This is where I delved into one-shot and few-shot learning, computer vision and robotics.Notable projects include [Face-Unlock](https://github.com/IvLabs/Face-Unlock/tree/main), [pid controller](https://github.com/ABD-01/ros_pid), teleoperation of turtle bot, [Object Detection](https://github.com/IvLabs/Object-Detection), [Siamese Neural Nets](https://github.com/ABD-01/Siamese-NN), etc. I even made [contributions](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/pulls?q=is%3Aclosed+is%3Apr+author%3AABD-01) to PyTorch's Vision library. 


I am also proud to mention that my research endeavors have led to the acceptance of a paper titled "[Open Set Multi Source Multi Target Domain Adaptation](https://ivlabs.github.io/os-nsmt/)," at the Neurips Pre-Registration Workshop 2019. Later, I worked under the guidance of [Prof. Konda Reddy](https://krmopuri.github.io/) from [IIT Guwahati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIT_Guwahati) on Dataset Condensation and [Coreset Extraction techniques](https://github.com/ABD-01/Coreset)

## Studies

**Would your application contribute to your ongoing studies/degree? If so, how?**

I am not currently not enrolled at any university.

But if you were to ask "if this would contribute to future studies/degree?"

Then definitely Yes!

I plan to pursue Masters in domains of Robotics and Deep Learning. I am planning to apply for the Fall '25 term.
Having GSoC experience with JdeRobot would doubtlessly help my application.

## Programming background
I owe a significant part of my programming journey to key mentors, including [Bucky Roberts](https://github.com/buckyroberts) (YouTube: [thenewboston](https://www.youtube.com/thenewboston)), [Prof. David J Malan](https://cs.harvard.edu/malan/) (Course: [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/), [Certificate](https://certificates.cs50.io/3a1e1887-2383-40f3-b442-dd914bfe7f12.pdf)), and [Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCezIgC97PvUuR4_gbFUs5g).

### <img src="_static/python.png" height="1em"> Python
In the realm of Python programming, I consider myself between an intermediate and advanced level.
While some measure expertise by counting lines of code, I've never kept a record. My Python projects span diverse domains, from *web scraping*, *data analysis*, and *image processing* to *deep learning*. I've crafted production-grade **GUIs** for vendors, developed **TCP servers**, created dynamic websites with **Flask**, implemented **function decorators**, explored perfplots, delved into meta-programming (Python scripts generating JS functions), and wrote **Sphinx** based documentation, among various other endeavors.

My open-source contributions too were in Python. Checkout my [course certificate](https://github.com/ABD-01/Python-for-Everybody)

### <img src="_static/c-programmin.png" height="1.2em"> C
While Python has dominated my programming landscape, C remains my first love and the cornerstone of my coding journey. 
The bulk of my bread and butter stems from C programming. 
My acdemic courses `CSL101` and `CSL210` were also focused on C language. In addition I've also worked with associated tools, such as makefiles and CMakeLists. 

### <img src="_static/Matlab_Logo.png" height="1em"> MATLAB
I have a degree in Electrical Engineer. Do you think one can escape the sleepless night of assigments and simulations in MATLAB?

## GSoC participation

**Have you participated to GSoC before?**

Nope

**Have you applied but were not selected? When?**

Yes! Twice! Fingers crossed for the 3rd time.

* For first time in GSoC 2021, the mentor hepled a lot in my proposal. I thank him for his time, motivated to keep applying next years. Applied to [INCF](https://www.incf.org/). I believe I lacked of skill then.

* Then next time applied to [OpenVINO](https://docs.openvino.ai/2023.3/home.html) and [Open3D](https://www.open3d.org/), completed their assignments ([Face-Verification](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks/pull/509) and [Sparse-Convolution](https://github.com/ABD-01/SparseConv) respectively), drafted decent proposal. 

* Organization said don't apply coz we already have lot's of competition.

**Have you submitted/will you submit another proposal for GSoC 2024 to a different org?**

I don't think so I will. 

This is the only proposal I have worked on so far.
