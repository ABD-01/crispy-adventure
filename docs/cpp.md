# C++ Challenge

This is my solution to the [C++ Challenge](where's the link? There was one C++ challenge but got removed) to show my understanding of C++.

I was about to develop the code for finding the longest path in the labyrinth, but I guess it was removed.

Anyways, this was my idea:

1. For all the entires, use DFS.
2. But we don't stop on finding the exit, and keep on continuing the DFS for other opening and other paths as well.
3. Loop through all the entries and select the one wil longest depth.
